# AGNoStep - agnostic GNUstep Desktop

## HELP

The help should be available from each Info menu. But this is not yet implemented as expected.
Work has been done. Things are in progress.

In the meanwhile, I provide two User Guides, also translated to French, avaiblable in the home user Help folder:

- AGNoStep User Guide.
- GWorkspace User Guide.

Note: path of these guides might change in the future.

You must install **HelpViewer** application to read these guides.
