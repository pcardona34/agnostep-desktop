# AGNoStep - agnostic GNUstep Desktop

## About dev releases (Beta Status)

All dev release are for my convenience.
Do not use them if you are not a developer understanding the code used.
Do not try nor report any issue until a release is tagged Stable.

## Changes

### Changes of the Release Beta 2.0.3

- This release ends the tests cycle on my laptop (MBPRO Intel model:6,2)
  - Battery plugging / unplugging is ok
  - Specific installation scripts and resources in RESOURCES/MACSET: keyboard, backlight, sound.
  - Detection at first stage (prep).
- Known issue: neither Mixer.app nor VolumeControl.app were able to adjust volume.

### Changes of the Release Beta 2.0.2

- This is an intermediate stage while testing on amd64 laptop, namely MBPro Intel: do not use yet.

### Changes of the Release Beta 2.0.1

- This release achieves 2.0.0 beta development on pi 500. Tests on amd64 and laptop yet to be done.
- Fixed several critic install issues on a fresh install.
- Dispatched agnostep main script to **agnowiz.sh** (core installation) and to **agnostep.sh** (applications manager).
- Tested all stages to get a strongest installation process.
- Updated install documentation.

### Changes of the Release Beta 2.0.0

This is a **major release** with many changes and improvements.

- Introduced new Native Agnostep in purpose Applications collection for a better Desktop and GNUstep experience: see [CORE_APPS](CORE_APPS.md) for the details: read section "Native GNUstep in purpose apps". 
- Some dockapps like `wmtext` were removed in favour of the new equivalent GNUstep applications: see *Meteo.app*, *UpMem.app*, *Updater.app* and *Birthday.app*. 
- Simplified desktop flavours to retain a single one, with Clip and Dock of WindowMaker: so the *Conky* flavour is deprecated since 2.0.0 release.
- Now, the Desktop can be installed without a theme (i.e. the default theme will be GNUstep). You can choose AGNOSTEP theme from the main menu of AgnostepManager then.
- **Settings** stage is more consistent: by example, the *laptop* test has been removed from theming to be executed while setting the X session...
- Thanks to the enhancements of *HelpViewer*, Help Folder has been removed because now all the help bundles will be installed at compile time for each relevant application: read [HELP](HELP.md) to search a particular help topic. This closes issue #9.
- Deprecated Subcategories in the Applications folder have been removed. We get back a flat organization which is more efficient with built-in first-letter filter. **Launcher** app is a shortcut to open the Applications folder.
- Theming has been provided again with the core repo of the project: [agnostep-theme](../../../../agnostep-theme) has been simplifed to collect only ARTS backup.
- A new collection of wallpapers for the rotate utility has been added: *Mallorca*.
- Now, the wallpaper will be handled by the Window Manager instead of GWorkspace. This choice permitted namely to fix issue #14, also thanks to the latest code of GWorkspace updated by Riccardo Mottola. 

> [!TIP]
> Agnostep Desktop will provide help within GWorkspace, Birthday, Launcher, OpenDisk, Pass, Printer, ScreenLock, SaveLink, Sound, Updater... Read [HELP](HELP.md).
