# Thanks and inspiration tributes

This project would never be accomplished without the inspiration, the work and the devotion of so many people for more than 35 years.

I think about:

- **1988**: The people who created, around Steve Jobs, the [NEXTSTEP Operating System](https://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/bs-nextstep.htm).
- The people who then ported and made available the specifications to [OPENSTEP](https://openstep.bfx.re/) and [Cocoa](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cocoa_Programming/Objective-C_basics).
- The people who documented and kept alive the knowledge about this master piece in the Industry of computers and softwares: among them, <https://levenez.com/NeXTSTEP/> (French); Georges Tarbouriech articles on the [LinuxFocus](http://www.linuxfocus.org/Francais/May2003/article291.shtml) magazine...
- The [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/), and namely Richard M. Stallman who often came to France to explain why Freedom is so important.
- The [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) community for their awesome free GNU/Linux operating system.
- The very useful [Advanced Bash Sctipting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) by Mendel Cooper.
- The authors of [Bash Dialog Boxes](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/dialog/dialog.1.en.html).
- The [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) who brought to us pi 400 and pi 500 small arm64 computers in a keyboard.
- Mainly the [GNUstep](https://www.gnustep.org) community who provides to us non only the named Framework inherited from OPENSTEP and Cocoa, but still so many great [applications](https://mediawiki.gnustep.org/index.php/Category:Applications) built with it. Namely Adam Fedor, Enrico Sersale who greatly contributed to GWorkspace. See a more complete [History](http://gnustep.made-it.com/Guides/History.html).
- The members of the [GNUstep Discuss-List](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss-gnustep/) who never stops to answer my newbie questions and to give me knowledge and expanations: namely Riccardo and Richard.
- The [Debian-Salsa GNUstep Team](https://salsa.debian.org/groups/gnustep-team/-/group_members) who provided so many useful patches and explanations, namely Yavor.
- The people who worked on the defunct but inspirant projects: [SimplyGNUstep](https://web.archive.org/web/20240618190512/http://www.simplygnustep.com/Main.html); [étoilé project](http://etoileos.com/)...
- The people who worked on [GNUstep theming](https://home.gnustep.org/experience/Theming.html), namely Bertrand Dekoninck for its [Sombre](https://github.com/gnustep/plugins-themes-sombre) theme.
- The authors of great available desktop projects:
  - Ondrej Florian for [GSDE](https://github.com/onflapp/gs-desktop)
  - Sergii Stoian for [NEXTSPACE](https://github.com/trunkmaster/nextspace).

  I hope to have mentioned everybody or communities.
