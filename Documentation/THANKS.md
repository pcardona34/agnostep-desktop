# Thanks and inspiration tributes

This project would never be accomplished without the inspiration, the work and the devotion of so many people for more than 40 years.

I think about:

- The people who created, around Steve Jobs, the NeXT Operating System.
- The people who then ported and made available the specifications to OPENSTEP and Cocoa.
- The people who then documented and kept alive the knowledge about this master piece in the Industry of computers and softwares.
- The Free Software Foundation, and namely Richard M. Stallman who often came to France to explain why Freedom is so important.
- The Debian community for their awesome free operating system.
- The Raspberry Pi Foundation.
- The GNUstep community who provided to us non only the named Framework inherited from OPENSTEP, but still so many great applications built with it.
- The members of the GNUstep Discuss-List who never stop to answer my newbie questions and to give me knowledge and expanations: namely Riccardo and Richard.
- The Debian-Salsa GNUstep Team who provided so many useful patches and explanations, namely Yavor.
- The people who worked on the defunct but so inspirant 'étoilé' project.
- The people who worked on GNUstep theming, namely Bertrand Dekoninck.
- The authors of great available desktop projects: Ondrej Florian for GSDE, Sergii Stoian for Nextspace.

  I hope to have mentioned everybody or communities.
