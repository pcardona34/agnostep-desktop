## I. How to install the Core Desktop (from SOURCES)

### CAUTION!

/!\ Do not install any related GNUstep debian package: this would conflict with the GNUstep built by AGNoStep and break your Desktop. To install something, use ever AGNoStep provided tools.

### Base OS and Locale

1) Install Minimal Debian: you can download the minimal installation image from the Debian website and create a bootable USB drive. Then, boot from the USB and follow the installation prompts to set up your system.
See: https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst

On Raspberry Pi, use instead `RPI Imager` to copy the Raspberry Pi Lite OS image on your SD card.

THE FOLLOWING MUST BE UPDATED AFTER FIRT TRY...

********************************************************

	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

You should get the latest Trixie release: 13.x as shown by:
	
	cat /etc/debian_version

4) Enable and install your desired locale:

- Uncomment your locale in '/etc/locale.gen':

	sudo nano /etc/locale.gen

- Generate your locale:

	sudo locale-gen

- Set your locale (adapt the command below to your locale):

	sudo localectl set-locale fr_FR.UTF-8

- Log out and Log in again to apply the new locale in your context.
- Verify the locale is correctly set:

	locale

- **Nota**: until now, installation scripts are only in English. L18N of AGNoStep depends of the state of the respective translations of the apps in the GNUstep project. For the Conky Panel or the dockapps of the Classic flavour (see agnostep-theme) French and English are available.

### Prerequisites

- Install 'git':

	sudo apt install git

- Create a 'SOURCES' directory to build all is needed:

	mkdir SOURCES && cd SOURCES

- Clone this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/pcardona34/agnostep
	cd agnostep
   cd install


### Start All-in-One install script

	./enjoy.sh

You can see progress and info messages while AGNoStep is installing.
After several minutes, you should be able to start the AGNoStep Desktop with 'startx'. 

If all is ok, logout and install the Display Manager (lightdm):

	./7_install_DM.sh

Now, after every login, the Desktop will be launched.

TIP: If you need to use CLI again, use TTY2 to login to the console: CTRL-ALT-F2.
	
---

If the above 'enjoy.sh' script failed for some reason, try the following manual steps to note the issue concerned:

### Prepare the installation (mainly build tools on debian dependencies):
	
(i) Tip: the point './' below means to search and execute the script in the current directory:

	./1_prep.sh

### Install Window Maker:

	./2_install_wmaker.sh

### Install the Core GNUstep:

	./3_install_gnustep.sh	
	
### Install the Frameworks:

	./4_install_frameworks.sh

### Install Core apps and Wrappers:

	./5_install_core_apps.sh

### Set the current user's environment and AGNOSTEP-theme:

	./6_user_settings.sh

### Start the X server and AGNoStep Desktop:
	
	cd && startx

### Notes

- If you want to regenerate your default user's setting or change the theme, log out the Desktop, log in a tty console and do that:
	./6_user_settings.sh

### If all is right, logout again and install the Display Manager form a tty console:

	./7_install_DM.sh

## II. How to install more apps?

- Logout the Desktop.
- cd ~/SOURCES/agnostep
- Run the Apps-Manager tool:
	./apps-mgr.sh
- From the menu shown, choose the software category: core apps, extra apps, developper, games...
- Update the User settings to apply the theme to newly installed apps:
   ./6_user_settings.sh

## III. How to remove some app?
