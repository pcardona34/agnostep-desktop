AGNOSTEP - agnostic GNUstep Desktop
===================================

- **Release**: 0.9.7
- **Status**: Beta

### Changes of the 0.9.7 release

- Using 'gnustep-config' and 'GNUstep.conf' to retrieve GNUstep env.
- AGNOSTEP theme now reached 0.5 stable release.

### Changes of the 0.9.6 release

- Cleaning obsolete things.

### Changes of the 0.9.5 release

Some issues fixed: better integration of agnostep-theme: dockapp 'wminfo' will install now within 'c5c' flavour of the theme.

### Changes of the 0.9.4 release

The new 0.9.4 release introduces a major change: now the theme will be available on its own at [agnostep-theme](https://github.com/pcardona/agnostep-theme).
The new theme will also provide two flavours: 'conky' and 'c5c': see the them site to know more about this.
Of course, AGNoStep Desktop will provide an integrated way of smoothly install it within the Desktop.
The User may also choose to not install the theme: so the default theme would be GNUstep, not AGNOSTEP.

Also new apps are available. See below the detailed list.

### Changes of the 0.9.3 release

Since 0.9.3 release, AGNoStep should run on all possible hardware, comprising all the Raspberry Pi's
known to work previously on the PiSiN project, mutatis mutandis. 
See the [HCL](HCL) file to know how to report a successful installation on your hardware.

### About the Status (see above)

- Alpha: means earlier developement stage. You should not use nor try, better is waiting.
- Beta: you may test to improve and help the project.
- Stable: Yet well tested. You can use it for a daily use.

### The Desktop Components

- Operating System: Debian Trixie 13.2.
- Window Manager: this is Window Maker 0.96.0 (debian default package version) with AGNOSTEP.themed and options: --no-dock  --no-clip --static. 
	Some apps and tools are launched with the 'autostart' script of Window Maker.
- Notifyer: dunst - With Release 9.2, DBusKit was back and so Desktop Notification from SimpleAgenda were successfully restored.
- Compositing: picom.
- System Infos: conky panel or dockapps wether you chose 'conky' or 'c5c' flavour of the AGNOSTEP theme. 
- Weather data is fetched from Wttr.in. 
- The system monitoring is upon: date, time, uptime, CPU, Memory, Storage and Networking. On Laptops, also Battery status is checked. 
	(Conky Panel is localized in French and in English)

Starting from 0.9.3 release, we try to add apps alternatives to all the sysinfos provided by conky.
-- Time: AClock (done)
-- Weather: Weather.app (done)
-- CPU / Mém.: TimeMon (todo)
-- Storage: provided by wmudmount
-- Network: wmnd

All the apps below were built from sources and so are the latest.
- Preferences Manager: SystemPreferences
- Workspace: GWorkspace and Recycler: 1.1.0 (02 2025) - Its own Desktop layer and its Dock (modern flavour) are shown. The Wallpaper is shown on this layer. It is a mandatory set to manage mounted removable devices on the Desktop and to unmount those by DND on the Recycler Icon. See AGNoStep User Guide to go in depth with removable disks.
- Theme: AGNOSTEP (previously PISIN) mostly inspired by Papirus Icon theme and GNUstep Sleek Theme.
- Session: Display Manager (Lightdm) and DBus (with DBUSKit support).
- Alsa compliant Audio Mixer: see VolumeControl below.
- RPI tools: only on RPI when the hardware is detected, if not substituted: cf. how to set default printer within CUPS in the AGNoStep User Guide.

================
INFO: We started from the release 0.8.3 and then 0.8.6 of PiSiN to make it agnostic. Many changes in the meanwhile.
