AGNOSTEP - agnostic GNUstep Desktop
===================================

INFO: We started from the release 0.8.3 and then 0.8.6 of PiSiN to make it agnostic. Many changes in the meanwhile.

- **Release**: 0.9.1
- **Status**: Stable

This release should run on all possible hardware, comprising all the Raspberry Pi's
known to work previously on the PiSiN project, mutatis mutandis. 
See the [HCL](HCL) file to know how to report a successful installation on your hardware.

### About the Status (see above)

- Alpha: means earlier developement stage. You should not use nor try, better is waiting.
- Beta: you may test to improve and help the project.
- Stable: Yet well tested. You can use it for a daily use.

### The Desktop Components

- Operating System: Debian Trixie 13.1.
- Window Manager: this is Window Maker 0.96.0 (debian default package version) with AGNOSTEP.themed and options: --no-dock  --no-clip --static. 
	Some apps and tools are launched with the 'autostart' script of Window Maker.
- Notifyer: dunst - SimpleAgenda won't use it because libDBUSKit is not installed.
- Compositing: compton.
- Sys Infos: conky. Weather data is fetched from Wttr.in. The system monitoring is upon: date, time, uptime, CPU, Memory, Storage and Networking.
	(Conky Panel is localized in French and in English)

- GNUstep: latest built from sources with GNU Runtime (not OBJC2). Use: `agostep --info` for a more complete release info.
All the apps below were built from sources and so are the latest.
- Preferences Manager: SystemPreferences
- Workspace: GWorkspace and Recycler: 1.1.0 (02 2025) - Its own Desktop layer and its Dock (modern flavour) are shown. The Wallpaper is shown on this layer. It is a mandatory set to manage mounted removable devices on the Desktop and to unmount those by DND on the Recycler Icon.
- Theme: AGNOSTEP mostly inspired by Papirus Icon theme and GNUstep Sleek Theme: finished.
- Session: Display Manager (Lightdm) and DBus (but without DBUSKit).
- Alsa compliant Audio Mixer: see VolumeControl below.
- RPI tools: only on RPI when the hardware is detected, if not substituted: cf. how to set default printer within CUPS in the UG.
- Password Manager: pass CLI.
